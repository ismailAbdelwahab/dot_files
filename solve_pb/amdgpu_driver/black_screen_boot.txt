The actual (05/03/2021) last version of the linux kernel have some pb with 
some graphic cards, like the Radeon RX 470 (on the main pc).

The pb is the following:
The driver (amdgpu) is downloaded, but the system don't use it:

When launching "$ lspci -v" go to the section about the gpu driver:
  You will see that line: "Kernel driver : amdgpu"
  but you can't see the line "Driver in user: amdgpu"
Meaning that amdgpu is not used.

To solve that just change the boot option in grub:
In the file /etc/default/grub :
  """
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash radeon.cik_support=1 amdgpu.cik_support=0 radeon.si_support=1 amdgpu.si_support=0 amdgpu.dc=0 amdgpu.dpm=0"
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
  """
Then just do: "$sudo update-grub2"

This will activate the use of the (amdgpu) driver by the kernel.
